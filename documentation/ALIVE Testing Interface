# ALIVE Testing Interface (GUI)

The `ALIVE Testing Interface` has 5 different windows:
- Input Interface
- Test Structure Biases [DAC Values]
- Bias Generator Configuration
- Log
- Encoder Output

The Log Window shows the history. The Input Interface is our Decoder, where we can enter which synapse we want to target and how many requests it should send. The Test Structure Biases is used for the two learning blocks LB CC and LB NN outside of the cores, whereas the Bias Generator Configuration can be used to change biases for the neurons, synapses and learning blocks inside the cores. In the Encoder Output, we can use `Handshake: Encoder`, if the connection seems to not work anymore.

Bias Generator Configuration will save the data in the `data/customBiasValues/BIASGEN/` folder. Even if you change the file name, it will be saved as `untitled.csv`. Be careful to change the name in Visual Studio, as the next saved file will overwrite this one if the name is not changed.

Test Structure Biases [DAC Values] saves the data in the `data/customBiasValues/DAC/` folder. Same as for the Bias Generator Configuration, it will be saved as `untitled.csv` and you need to rename it in Visual Studio.
